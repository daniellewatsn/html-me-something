            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <h3>OR "How I learned to love knitting and abandon all other adult responsibilities"</h3>
            <p id="paragraph1">My foray into knitting mania began simply and innocently. Little did I know that it would lead me to become the obsessive yarn&#8209;buyer and knitting&#8209;circle&#8209;goer that I am today.</p>
            <p>I started learning to knit in what I though was a benign manner &mdash; simply by making a few hats to be given to my family for Christmas. I would later learn, at the cozy evenings around the table at knitting night, that gift&#8209;knitting is one of the most stressful parts of a knitters life. It should be avoided at all costs. If one is to gift knit, it should be done in the context of a casual "I was just thinking of you and decided to knit this thing", instead of the way I did it. I attempted to make three quite complicated hats (for a beginner knitter) in the space of a month. </p>
            <p>After my whirlwind month of knitting into the wee hours of the night, I began to see that what I was embarking on was much more than just a passing hobby. I started inhaling every youtube video I could, teaching myself the ins and outs of every new technique that came up in my patterns. Pretty soon I was spending scads on new yarn. Beautiful merino wool, cool cottons, and even the odd luxurious cashmere, I would indulge in them all. I started to make the prettiest little stuffed animals for my neices and nephews. Even though I had vowed not to gift knit, I began a tradition of giving them each a personally knitted lovie for their first Christmas. That tradition continues today. For my next neice or nephew (and there will be many, since I have 3 siblings), I will knit a lion.</p>
